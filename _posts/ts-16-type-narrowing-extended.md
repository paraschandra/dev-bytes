Up til now we've only focused around narrowing single variables with simple types like `string`, `boolean`, and `number`.
While this is common, most of the time in JavaScript weâ€™ll be dealing with slightly more complex structures.

Lets take an example of an interface dealing with the shapes and their dimensions:
```ts
interface Shape {
  kind: "circle" | "square";
  radius?: number;
  sideLength?: number;
}
```
The problem with this is the dimensions are optional and there's always a possibility that these remain undefined which will cause error...
```ts
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  if (shape.kind === "circle") {
    return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    // 'shape.radius' is possibly 'undefined'.
  }
}
```

This can be solved by properly separating `Shape` out into two types with different values of `kind` and properties declared as required this is what Discriminated union do.

A **Discriminated Union** in TypeScript is a union of types with a common literal field, known as a "discriminant" or "tag." This field is usually a string or number literal unique to each member of the union, allowing TypeScript to narrow down the type based on that field.
```ts
interface Circle {
  kind: "circle";
  radius: number;
}
 
interface Square {
  kind: "square";
  sideLength: number;
}
 
type Shape = Circle | Square;
```

Now, instead of checking for `kind` property again and again, the same checking can be done with switch cases...
```ts
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case "circle":
      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;

    case "square":
      return shape.sideLength ** 2;
  }
}
```

### Exhaustiveness Checking with `never`:
When you use a switch statement or other type-checking structures, TypeScript will verify that all possible cases of the discriminated union are handled. The never type is used to confirm that a condition will never occur; if all cases are not covered, TypeScript raises an error in the default case.

```ts
type Shape =
  | { kind: 'circle'; radius: number }
  | { kind: 'square'; side: number }
  | { kind: 'rectangle'; width: number; height: number };

function area(shape: Shape): number {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case 'circle':
      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    case 'square':
      return shape.side ** 2;
    case 'rectangle':
      return shape.width * shape.height;
    default:
      // TypeScript knows `shape` should never reach here
      const _exhaustive: never = shape;
      return _exhaustive; // This will raise an error if we add a new type to `Shape` but don't handle it here
  }
}
```
>This technique ensures that the function is exhaustive and future-proof against additions to the union type.

That's all in this series of `TypeScript`. Will see you in another one.
